### Supermarket Monitoring
> Supermarket web application to help owner manage their stock more conveniently

Sumo is a role-based application that helps supermarkets run its business. As an employee, this app can be used in transactions where goods that are being bought can be scanned. Scanned items will be required to input the amount of which the goods are bought and when submitted, Sumo will interact with the database for stock updating.
